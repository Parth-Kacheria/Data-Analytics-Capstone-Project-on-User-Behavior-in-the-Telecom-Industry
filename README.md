This project was created for an INSAID (International School of AI and Data Science) Capstone Project on Data Analytics for user behavior in the Telecom industry.


**Data Description**

In this assignment, the goal is to study the demographics of a user (gender and age) based on their app download and usage behaviors.

The data schema can be represented as:

**1. gender_age_train** - Devices and their respective user gender, age and age_group 

**2. phone_brand_device_model** - device ids, brand, and models phone_brand: note that few brands are in Chinese

**3. events_data** - when a user uses mobile on the Telecom network, the event gets logged in this data.

 - Each event has an event id, location (lat/long), and the event corresponds to frequency of mobile usage.
 - timestamp: when the user is using the mobile.
